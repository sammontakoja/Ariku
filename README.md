# Ariku ![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/sammontakoja/Ariku.svg?branch=master)
Ariku is a platform for creating different kind of competitions.

## History
Finnish shooting clubs run shooting competitions with old program(s) which are full of bugs
and hard to change.

Ariku project's original idea was to create new program for them which works and is simpler to use.

Original plan grew little larger and now Ariku project's focus is on providing services to any kind of competition.
