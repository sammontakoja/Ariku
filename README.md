# Ariku

Ariku is a online program for those who need to get or modify information related to shooting competitions.

Ariku focus on three different user groups: competition holders, competitors and viewers.

Example competition holders use Ariku to produce scoresheets, competitors can attend to competition via Ariku
and reporters (as viewer) can get scoresheets from Ariku.

## History

Finnish shooting clubs run shooting competitions with old programs which are full of bugs
and hard to change.

Ariku project's main idea is to create new program which really works and is simpler to use.

Ariku project started as Finnish shooting clubs wanted new competition program but
there's no reason why other than Finnish clubs or individuals cannot use this program.

Example [Olympic skeet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_skeet) is international sport
and sport's competitions are hold in over 30 countries.
