# Ariku

Ariku is a program for those who are interested about shooting competitions.

Ariku focus on three different user groups: competition holders, competitors and viewers.

As an example 
a) competition holder may use Ariku to produce scoresheets
b) competitor can attend to competition via Ariku
c) reporter (as viewer) can get scoresheets from Ariku.

## History

Finnish shooting clubs run shooting competitions with old programs which are full of bugs
and hard to change.

Ariku project's main idea is to create new program which really works and is simpler to use.

Ariku project started as Finnish shooting clubs wanted new competition program but
there's no reason why other than Finnish clubs or individuals cannot use this program.

Example [Olympic skeet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_skeet) is international sport
and sport's competitions are hold in over 30 countries.

## Architecture

Architecture is divided into two categories: **internal** and **external** architecture.

External architecture contains use cases and describe what parts are under focus.

Internal architecture describe way to implement use cases.

At the moment internal architecture is built upon four modules: verification module, 
competition holder module, participant module and viewer module.

More about architecture can be found from [here](architecture.md).
