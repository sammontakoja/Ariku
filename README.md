## History

Finnish shooting clubs run shooting competitions with old programs which are full of bugs
and hard to change.

Ariku project's main idea is to create new program which really works and is simpler to use.

Ariku project started as Finnish shooting clubs wanted new competition program but
there's no reason why other than Finnish clubs or individuals cannot use this program.

Example [Olympic skeet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_skeet) is international sport
and sport's competitions are hold in over 30 countries.
